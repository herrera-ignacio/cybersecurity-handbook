# IEEE 802

In February 1980, a committee called the _802 Working Group_) took over from the private sector the job of defining network standards. The IEEE 802 committee defines the following standards for network environments:

* Frames
* Speeds
* Distances
* Types of cabling

Each subcommittee is officially called a _working group_:
