# IDS/IPS

Like [firewalls](../README.md), _intrusion detection system_ (IDS) and _intrusion prevention system_ (IPS) are also software-based components.

IDS scans the network for __potential attacks__, analyzes them, and reports any detected attacks. IPS complements IDS by taking specific __defensive measures__ if a potential attack should have been detected.

The analysis of such attacks is based on __pattern matching__ and __signatures__. If specific patterns are detected, such as a service detection scan, __IPS__ may prevent the pending connection attempts.
