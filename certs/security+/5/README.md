## 1. Policies, Plans & Procedures

* Policies
  * Document Types
  * Elements
  * Common policies
* Procedures (SOP: Standard Operating Procedure)
  * Agreements
  * Personal Management

### Policies

Policies form the foundation of any security program.

* How IT will approach security
* How users approach security
* How certain situations will be handled

#### Policy Document Types

* __Policies__: general management rules.
* __Standards__: specific mandatory controls, based on a given policy.
* __Guidelines__: recommendation or good practices.
* __Procedures__: instructions on how to implement a policy or standard.

#### Policy Elements

* Overview
* Purpose
* Scope
* Target Audience
* Definitions
* Version
* Implementation Date
* Compliance / Exceptions
* Policy Statements

#### Common Policies

* Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
* Access
* Authentication
* Backup & Recovery
* Data Classification
* Email / Messaging
* Social Media
* Physical Security
* Incident Response
* Mobile Device
* Network Security (Wireless, Remote)

### Procedures (SOP: Standard Operating Procedure)

Standard set of instructions for workers to carry out routine operations. Aim to achieve efficiency and consistent output.

#### Agreements

* __Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)__: protects against sensitive information disclosure.
* __Business Partner Agreement (BPA)__: specifies partner financial and dfiduciary responsibilities (profit sharing).
* __Service-level Agreement (SLA)__: specifies nature and level of service by a provider (uptime).
* __Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)__ and __Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)__: outlines the terms and details of an agreement.
* __Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA)__.

#### Personnel Management

## 2. Business Impact Analysis

* The process of evaluating all of the critical systems (important to core business functions) in an organization to define impact and recovery plans.
* Determining the potential impacts (costs, resources, time) resulting from the interruption of time-sensitive or critcal business processes.
* Identify crtical business functions, systems, services, and technologies along with the cost associated with their loss and the maximum acceptable outage period.

### Critical Functions

Mission-essential functions, roles, services, systems, applications or data required to sustain business.

1. Identification & Analysis
2. Prioritization
3. Calcuating a timeframe for critical system loss
4. Estimating the tangible and intangible impact on the organization

### Single Point of Failure

* One fault or malfunction can compromise an entire system or enterprise
* Can be people or technology
* Are avoided with redundancy and fault-tolerant protocols/procedures (HA - High Availability)

### Recovery Objectives

* __RTO__: maximum amount of time that a process or service is allowed to be down and the consequences still to be considered acceptable.
* __RPO__: point last known good data prior to an uotage that is used to recover systems.

### Average time measurement

* __Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)__: Average time to failure for a nonrepairable system. Represents how long a product can reasonably be expected to perform, based on specific testing.
* __Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)__: Measure of the anticipated incidence of failure for a system or component.
* __Mean Time to Recovery/Restore/Repair (MTTR)__: Average time required to repair a failed system, device, or component, and return it to operational status.

### Privacy Assessments

* __Personally Identifiable Information (PII)__: Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, etc. Alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc. (NIST)

* __Personal Health Information (PHI)__.

* __Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)__: identifies the adverse impacts that can be associated with the destruction, loss, corruption, or accidental disclosure of sensitive, personal or private data for the organization. Required for any organization that collects, uses, stores, or porcesses PII or PHI.

* __Privacy Treshold Assessment (PTA)__: Determines whether a system contains PII or PHI.
