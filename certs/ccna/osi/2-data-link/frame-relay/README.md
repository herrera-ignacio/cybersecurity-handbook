# Frame Relay

Frema Relay is a packet-switching telecommunication service designed for intermittent traffic between local area networks (LANs) and endpoints in wide area networks (WANs). The main difference with Ethernet is that Frame Relay is a __non-broadcast multi-access technoloy__ (NBMA), so unlike Ethernet, there is no layer 2 Frame Relay destination broadcast address.

Frame Relay puts data in a variable-size unit called a Frame and leaves any necessary error correction up to the endpoints, which speeds up overall data transmission.
