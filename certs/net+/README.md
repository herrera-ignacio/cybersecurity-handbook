## Topics

Topic organization and certification objectives are listed as in "Network+ Exam Guide Seventh Edition" by Mike Meyers.

### 1. Network Models

Network+ exam expects you to know how to:

* 1.2 Explain devices, applications, protocols and services at their appropriate OSI layers.
* 1.3 Explain the concepts and characteristics of routing and switching.

To achieve these goals you must be able to:

* Describe how models such as the OSI seven-layer model and the TCP/IP help technicians understand and troubleshoot networks.
* Explain the major functions of networks with OSI.
* Describe the major functions of networks with TCP/IP.

### 2. Cabling and Topology

Network+ exam expects you to know how to:

* 1.5 Compare and contrast the characteristics of network topologies, types and technologies.
* 2.1 Given a scenario, deploy the appropriate cabling solution.

To achieve these goals you must be able to:

* Explain the different types of network topologies.
* Describe the different types of network cabling and connectos.
* Describe the IEEE networking standards.

### 3. Ethernet Basics

Network+ exam expects you to know how to:

* 2.1 Given a scenario, deploy the appropriate cabling solution.
* 2.2 Given a scenario, determine the appropriate placement of networking devices on a network and install/configure them.
* 4.6 Explain common mitigation techniques and their purposes.

To achieve these goals you must be able to:

* Define and describe Ethernet.
* Explain early Ethernet implementations.
* Describe ways to enhance and extend Ethernet networks.

## [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting)

### Steps

1. Identify problem
2. Gather infomration
3. Establish theory of cause
4. Test theory
5. Determine plan of action to resolve the problem
6. Implement the plan
7. Verify system functionality
8. Document!

### Tools

* `ping`: Determine connectivity.
* `traceroute/tracert`: Determine route (hops) to destination.
* `NSLookup/Dig`: DNS troubleshooting, see if you can resolve to an IP address.
* `ipconfig/ifconfig`: Information about current host.
* `netstat`: View all active connections of host.
* `route`: Current routing table.
