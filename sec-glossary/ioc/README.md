# IOC: Indicator of Compromise

Pieces of __forensic data__, such as data found in system log entries or files, that __identify potentially malicious activity__ on a system or network.

IOC aid in detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity. By monitoring for IOC, organizations can detect attacks and act quickly to prevent breaches from occurring or limit damages by stopping attacks in earlier stages.

IOC act as breadcrumbs that lead infosec teams to __detect malicious activity early in the attack sequence__. These unusual activities are the red flags that indicate a potential or in progress attack that could lead to a data breach or systems compromise.

## IOC vs Indicators of Attack (IOA)

IOA are simlar to IOCs, but rather than focusing on forensic analysis of a compromise that has already taken place, __IOA focus on identifying attacker activity while an attack is in progress__.

IOCs help answer the question _"What happened?"_, while IOAs can help answer questions like _"What is happening and why?"_.
