# Source Code Review

The quality of source code review rests on whether or not you're manually reviewing the whole app. Using static analysis tools is quick, but it won't reliably find many classes of bugs.

When doing manual review, you are going to work much slower, but with a much higher quality result.

## Static Analysis Tools

#### [OWASP Static Analysis Tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

It's a great product, but it prices are really high, which makes it impractical for many puroses.
