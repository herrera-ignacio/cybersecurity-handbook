# Exploiting Manual Web Application Findings

* SQLi: SQL Injection
* XSS: Cross-site scripting
* CSRF: Cross-site request forgery
* Session Token Entropy
* Fuzzing/Input validation
* Business logic

> Although these aren't all of the different types of tests to validate, these generally provide the major findings and give you a good baseline for learning other types of web-based attacks.

## SQLi

SQLi vulnerabilities can lead to a full compromise of the database or of the system itself. Two open source tools commonly used are [SQLMap](../../../tools/web/sqlmap) and [Sqlninja](../../../tools/web/sqlninja).

## XSS

This is probably one of the most common vulnerabilities to identify. XSS is a user attack that is caused by the lack of input validation of the application. XSS attacks can be reflective and stored, which allow an attacker to write script code into a user's browser. With *reflective XSS* we need to use social engineering to trick the victim into going to the link that will trigger the XSS. If it were *stored XSS*, we most likely only need to wait until our code was executed.

If you find an XSS, you can not only cause a victim to become part of your pseudo-botnet, you can also steal the contents of the copy memory, redirect them to links, turn on their camera, and so much more.
