# Exploiting Manual Web Application Findings

* SQLi: SQL Injection
* XSS: Cross-site scripting
* CSRF: Cross-site request forgery
* Session Token Entropy
* Fuzzing/Input validation
* Business logic

> Although these aren't all of the different types of tests to validate, these generally provide the major findings and give you a good baseline for learning other types of web-based attacks.

## SQLi

SQLi vulnerabilities can lead to a full compromise of the database or of the system itself. Two open source tools commonly used are [SQLMap](../../../tools/web/sqlmap) and [Sqlninja](../../../tools/web/sqlninja).
