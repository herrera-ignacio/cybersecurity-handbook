## What is HIPAA?

HIPAA stands for _Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act_, is a US federal law approved on 1996, that required the creation of national standard to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's conset or knowledge.

The _US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)_ issued the _HIPAA Privacy Rule_ to implement the requeriments of HIPAA.

## Rules

### HIPAA Privacy Rule.

* Standards for PHI and PII.
* Right to access. 

Privacy Rule standards __address the use and disclosure of individuals' health information (PHI: Protected Health Information) and personal information (Personally Identifiable Information)__ by entities subject to the Privacy Rules. These individuals and organizations are called "__covered entities__".

Privacy Rule also contains standards for __individuals' rights to understand and control how their health information is used__.

A major goal is to ensure that individuals' PHI is __properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care and to protect the public's health and well-being__. It strikes a balance that permits important uses of information while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing.

### HIPAA Security Rule

While HIPAA Privacy Rule safeguards PHI, the Security Role __protects a buset of information covered by the Privacy Rule__. This subset is __all individually identifiable health information a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits in electronic form__. This information is called "__Electronic Protected Health Information (e-PHI)__". The Security Rule does not apply to PHI transmitted orally or in writing.

To comply with HIPAA Security Rule, all covered entities must do the following:

* Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all electronic PHI.
* Detect and safeguard against anticipated threats to the security of information.
* Protect against anticipated impermissible uses of disclosures.
* Certify compliance by their workforce.

Security Rule cover:

* Security standards for the protection of e-PHI.
* Administrative Safeguards.
* Physical Safeguards.
* Technical Safeguards.
