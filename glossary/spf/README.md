# SPF: Sender Policy Framewrok

## Overview

Technical standard, form of email authentication, that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, spoofing, and phishing.

It defines a way to __validate that an email message was sent from an authorized mail server__, in order to detect forgery and to prevent spam. It was designed to __supplement SMTP__, because SMTP does not include any authentication mechanisms.

## SPF Record

An SPF record is included in an organization's DNS database. An SPF record is a specially-formatted version of a standard DNS TXT record.
