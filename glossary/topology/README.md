# Topology

Layout of the connections between devices. Every topology has advantages/disadvantages.

* Bus
* Ring
* Mesh
* Star

## Ring Networks

* Devices connected to a closed loop cable.
* No terminating ends, if one crashes all network crashes.
* Devices functon as repeaters.
* Tokens are required to send data.

## Bus

* Devices (nodes) are connected to a single linear cable (trunk).
* Each end of cable must be terminated, to prevent signal rebounding back to the cable.

## Mesh

* Full or Partial.
* All or most computeres are connected to each other.
* Expensive.
* High redundancy (many routes and multiple links).

## Star

* Most common type of network topology.
* All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
* Decent amount of redundancy.
