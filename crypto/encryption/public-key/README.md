# Public Key (Assymetric Encryption)

Public Key Encryption, is a method of encrypting data with two different keys and making one of the keys (Public Key) available for anyone to use.

Data encrypted with the public key, can only be decrypted with the private key.

This method is widely used, especially for TLS/SSL, which makes HTTPS possible.
