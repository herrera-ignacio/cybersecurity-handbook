# Cybersecurity Guidelines

## :pushpin: Description

This attemps to be a guideline for Cybersecurity knowledge. I believe this is the kinds of topics that encourages you to persue your curiosity and lets you decide how depth to dive in a specific subject.

One problem with Cybersecurity nowadays is that there might not be a clear path if you want to make a career, neither a lot of information of which paths are available right now. There's not limited ways to become a Cybersecurity expert, neither required certifications or degrees, but I intend to put some lights into your road at least, which you may find helpful whenever you don't know where to start or where to go next.

## :memo: How To Use

* Each section tries to give a practical introduction to the topic it concerns.
* Lots of sections encourages practice on your own, which is needed if you want to make a profession out of this and not here just for curiosity.
* Most topics won't be coverages in depth but rather let you know if you are interested it in further research or not.
