# Cybersecurity Guidelines

## :pushpin: Description

This attemps to be a guideline for Cybersecurity knowledge. I believe this is the kinds of topics that encourages you to persue your curiosity and lets you decide how depth to dive in a specific subject.

One problem with Cybersecurity nowadays is that there might not be a clear path if you want to make a career, neither a lot of information of which paths are available right now. There's not limited ways to become a Cybersecurity expert, neither required certifications or degrees, but I intend to put some lights into your road at least, which you may find helpful whenever you don't know where to start or where to go next.

## :memo: How To Use

* Each section tries to give a practical introduction to the topic it concerns.
* Each topic is only described in an introductory way, so you can understand the underlying concept. Learning how to apply those concepts in real-life scenarios is up to you to research and experiment.
* Most sections encourages/require practice on your own, this is needed if you want to make a profession out of this and it's not just for curiosity.
