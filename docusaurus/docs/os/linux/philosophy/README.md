# Philosophy

Linux follows five core principles:

- [Philosophy](#philosophy)
  - [Everything is a file](#everything-is-a-file)
  - [Small, single-purpose programs](#small-single-purpose-programs)
  - [Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks](#ability-to-chain-programs-together-to-perform-complex-tasks)
  - [Avoid captive user interfaces](#avoid-captive-user-interfaces)
  - [Configuration data stored in a text file](#configuration-data-stored-in-a-text-file)

## Everything is a file

All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux OS are stored in one ore more text files.

## Small, single-purpose programs

Linux tools can be combined to work together. Each tool should perform only one task and should do it well.

## Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks

The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large nad complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results.

## Avoid captive user interfaces

Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell/terminal, which gives the user greater control over the operating system and decision over which GUI to use (if any).

## Configuration data stored in a text file

An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file.
