# Serial Connections

A Router will have a serial connection to a __CSU/DSU__, which is the termination/demarcation point for the ISP, where the ISPs responsibility ends. The CSU/DSU then connects to the ISP cloud, and on the other end, there will be another CSU/DSU connecting to your remote side router.

## CSU/DSU: Channel Service Unit / Data Service Unit

* DCE (Data Connection Equipment Device)
  * Provides clocking, the physical bit transfer rate between local and remote router.
