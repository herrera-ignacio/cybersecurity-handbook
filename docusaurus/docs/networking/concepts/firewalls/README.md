# Firewalls

## Overview

A firewall is a security measure against __unauthorized connections attempts__ from external networks.

Every firewall security system is based on a software component that monitors network traffic between the firewall and incoming data connections and __decides how to handle the connection__ based on a set of rules.

It checks whether individual network __packets__ are being __passed__, __ignored__, or __blocked__.  This mechanism is desired to __prevent unwanted connections__ that could be potentially dangerous.
