## History

It was formed in response to the slow development of __W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) web standards__ and W3C's decision to abandon HTML in favor of XML-based technologies.

On 2007, the new HTML working group of W3C adopted the WHATWG's HTML5 standard. Since them, W3C and WHATWG have been developing HTML independently, at times causing specificatons to diverge.

In 2017, WHATWG established an intellectual property rights agreement that includes a patent policy.

In 2019, the W3C and WHATWG agreed to a memorandum of understanding where development of HTML and DOM speciications would be done principally in the WHATWG. This also stablishes that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards, stoping the publishing competing standards since 2012.
