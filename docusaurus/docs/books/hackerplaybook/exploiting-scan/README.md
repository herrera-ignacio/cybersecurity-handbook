# Exploiting Scanner Findings

## Using Tools

* [Metasploit](../../../tools/frameworks/metasploit)

## Custom Scripts

You can find exploits for vulnerabilities that wereen't in Metasploit or other framework. Usualy searching for vulnerabilities based on version numbers from the *banner grabbing script*, you can find exploits in other places. A lot of the time, the scripts will be written exploits will be wrirten in some scripting language.

As a penetration tester, you need to be familiar with how to edit, modify, execute, and understand regardless of the language and be able to understand why an exploit works.

* How do you run the exploit? What language is it? Do you need to compile it or are there any libraries you need to import?

* Are there any depedencies required such as a given version of Windows or Linux? DEP or ASLR?

* Are the EIP addresses or any other registers or padding values hardcoded to specific versions? Do they need to be modified?

* Will the exploit take down the service? Do you only have one change at compromising the host?
